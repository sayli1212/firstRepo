VERSION CONTROL:

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time

git:
Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). 
Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular 
version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, 
every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.
